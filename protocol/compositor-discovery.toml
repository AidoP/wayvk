Subcompositors may run within a main wayland compositor providing various extra services atop the primary compositor.
For example, the notification system may be implemented by a subcompositor providing the notification protocol on another wayland socket whilst creating a window and showing notifications on the primary compositor.

When a compositor becomes available, or at global bind time, a set of available events specifying the global and path to compositor are sent. Multiple events per subcompositor path may be sent.
